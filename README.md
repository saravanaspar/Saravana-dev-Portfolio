# Portfolio / N. SaravanaKumar

## What is this?
I got tired of portfolios that take 10 seconds to load because they are bloated with heavy frameworks.

So I built this one using the **"Speed Stack"** (just HTML and CSS).
- **Lighthouse Score:** 100/100.
- **Dependencies:** Zero.
- **Build Time:** 0 seconds.

## The Projects
I can't show the source code for these (client IP), but here is what they do:

### 1. AnimeWallFX (Live)
It’s a wallpaper gallery. Most gallery sites are slow and jumpy. This one isn't.
- **Tech:** React, Supabase, heavy virtualization.
- **The Flex:** Loads thousands of images without crashing Chrome.

### 2. AlbionToolkit (Coming Soon)
A calculator for Albion Online.
- **The Problem:** Spreadsheets are ugly and slow.
- **The Fix:** I moved all the math to the client-side. Updates instantly.
- **Tech:** TypeScript, Local JSON logic.

## Why hire me?
I specialize in **Agency Overflow**.
You know those complex backend tasks or logic-heavy React components your design team hates touching? **I do those.**

I also do 3D stuff (Blender/Three.js) if you need that.
